        <p>In this game, there are two players: the protagonist and the snake. <br>
        The protagonist's goal is to reach a score of 25 before being killed by the snake, while the <br>
        snake's wishes to kill the protagonist before they reach that objective. <br> <br> <br>
        In order to collect points, the protagonist must eat apples. However, the snake can also
        eat apples. <br> Depending on which type of apple is eaten and by which player, an additional
        <br> effect is achieved each time one is eaten. <br> <br> <br>
        <b id = "red">Red</b> apples add one to the score when eaten by the protagonist, and add one unit to the snake if eaten by the snake.
        <br> <b id = 'white'>Life</b> apples increment the score by one and give the player an extra life if consumed by the player, while growing the snake if consumed by the snake.
        <br> <b id = "lime">Lime</b> apples add 5 to the score when eaten by the protagonist, and subtracts one from the score while still growing the snake when eaten by the snake.
        <br> <b id = "gold">Golden</b> apples add 3 to the score and shrink the snake back down to it's original size when eaten by the protagonist,<br>
        and grow the snake by two units when eaten by the snake.<br>
        <b id = "black">Death</b> apples are extremely rare black apples that ensure victory for the consumer, setting the score to 100 if eaten by the protagonist <br>
        and setting the score to 0 and teleporting the protagonist into the snake's clutches if eaten by the snake. <br><br><br>
        The protagonist uses the arrow pad to move, while the snake uses WASD to move and cannot change direction directly 180 degrees from it's current trajectory.<br></p>
